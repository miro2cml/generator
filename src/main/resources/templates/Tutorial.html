            <p>The first thing you have to do is authenticate yourself with Miro. Afterwards your boards will appear in
            the gray list. <!-- [Q]: where is the gray list? --> Choose your board type and select your Miro board you like to convert, as shown in the figure.</p>

            <p>With the Button "Map Board", you can convert your board. When the conversion is finished, a new field appears:
            Context Mapper Output. If the first section is green, the input board was perfect. In the figure
                you can see such an output. If the first section is orange, there are some small errors. If it is red,
                the board could not be converted. The log file and the colored section explain
                what went wrong. The preview shows the CML output or the log file if something went wrong. The files
                can be downloaded via the button "Download Logfile" <!-- [W] better "Log File" (code change) --> and "Download CML".</p>

            <br>
            <h6>Board Type: EducatedGuess</h6>
            <p>You can also set the board type to "EducatedGuess" <!-- "Guessed" -> "Guess" -->. The converter then decides which
                template was used (by looking for mappable elements) and maps the board accordingly.</p>
